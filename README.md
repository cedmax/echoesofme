# Echoes of me
[Echoesof.me](http://echoesof.me) is a website that enables [Shazam](http://www.shazam.com) users to create playlists with their data.

At the moment it works pretty well with [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com), and there're alphas of [Youtube](http://echoesof.me/youtube.html) and [Deezer](http://echoesof.me/deezer.html) integrations.

Overall the code pretty much sucks and would need a huge refactoring, but it wasn't meant to be anything more than an exploration of spotify's APIs.
